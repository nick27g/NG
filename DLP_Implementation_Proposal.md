## Proposal Overview

### Problem Summary
A-Z Billing, a medical billing company serving surgery centers in the Midwest, faces increased data security challenges. With recent growth and a new office, handling sensitive patient and billing information has become more complex. To meet HIPAA regulations and mitigate risks like data breaches, A-Z Billing requires a robust solution to prevent unauthorized access or accidental data loss.

### IT Solution
To secure sensitive information, A-Z Billing will implement a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution. This system will monitor data at rest, in transit, and in use, ensuring protection across network and endpoint devices. Key features include real-time alerts, encryption, and access controls, integrated into the existing IT infrastructure, with a user-friendly interface for reporting and managing security incidents.

## Implementation Plan

### Phases
- **Assessment Phase**: Review current data processes to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Planning Phase**: Define requirements, goals, and resources for HIPAA compliance.
- **Tool Selection Phase**: Evaluate DLP solutions for monitoring and alerting.
- **Deployment Phase**: Install and configure the DLP system.
- **Testing Phase**: Conduct tests, simulate breaches, and make adjustments.
- **Training and Awareness Phase**: Educate employees on data handling and security.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance Phase**: Ongoing system monitoring and audits.

## Review of Other Work

Studies highlight the need for DLP in healthcare to mitigate insider threats and prevent data breaches. Research supports the use of DLP solutions to enforce HIPAA compliance and protect sensitive information, guiding A-Z Billingâ€™s approach to deploying a scalable DLP system that addresses insider actions and strengthens data security.

---

## Project Rationale

Implementing a DLP solution is essential for A-Z Billing to safeguard sensitive data and comply with HIPAA. This solution will enhance operational efficiency, automate data management, and reduce human error, all while providing real-time monitoring and access controls to prevent data breaches.

---

## Current Project Environment

A-Z Billing operates with Dell OptiPlex desktops on Windows 11, managed through Cisco Meraki network devices. Data is stored using Synology NAS and Microsoft OneDrive, but the infrastructure lacks centralized data monitoring, increasing the risk of data breaches.

---

## Methodology

Following the Waterfall methodology, the project includes five phases:
- **Requirements**: Define DLP needs and scope.
- **Design**: Outline integration and security measures.
- **Implementation**: Deploy DLP across network and devices.
- **Verification**: Conduct testing for compliance and functionality.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing updates and security monitoring.
