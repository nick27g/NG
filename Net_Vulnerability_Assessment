### Abstract

This vulnerability assessment aims to locate, document, evaluate, and identify all active hosts within the target network. The goal is to uncover possible vulnerabilities in both the network and individual hosts by examining operating system and service versions, their availability, and configurations. These findings are based on a mix of active network scanning and passive analysis of network traffic.

### Summary of Vulnerabilities and Implications  

1. **Vulnerability**: CVE-2005-0851  
   - **Port**: 21/tcp  
   - **State**: Open  
   - **Service**: FTP  
   - **Version**: FileZilla ftpd  
   - **Found on Host**: 10.168.27.15  
   - **Implications**: FileZilla versions before 0.9.6 with Mode Z contain a vulnerability allowing a remote attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service attack (DoS), potentially crashing the system. [More Info](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0851)

2. **Vulnerability**: CVE-2022-1668  
   - **Port**: 22/tcp  
   - **State**: Open  
   - **Service**: SSH  
   - **Version**: OpenSSH 5.5pl  
   - **Found on Hosts**: 10.168.27.14, 10.168.27.15, 10.168.27.20, 10.168.27.132  
   - **Implications**: OpenSSH 5.5pl allows weak default credentials for root, enabling attackers to gain superuser privileges. [More Info](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1668)

3. **Vulnerability**: CVE-2019-14897  
   - **OS Details**: Linux 2.6.32  
   - **Found on Hosts**: 10.168.27.14, 10.168.27.20, 10.168.27.132  
   - **Implications**: Vulnerability in the Marvell WiFi chip in Linux kernel 2.6.32, enabling DoS attacks or arbitrary code execution. [More Info](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14897)

### Wireshark Anomalies  

1. **Anomaly**: ICMP packets with the "Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)" tag between hosts 10.16.80.243, 10.168.27.10, and 10.16.80.2. Most packets originate from host 10.16.80.243 with a length of 120 bytes.

2. **Anomaly**: SSHv2 packets with a length of 850 bytes, with info tag indicating "server-side spurious retransmission through TCP" during key exchange. Source IPs vary, destination IP is 10.16.80.243.

3. **Anomaly**: Packet number 213818 shows FTP response code 331 with the argument "Give any password," indicating a valid username with any password allowed.

---

### Implications of each Wireshark Anomaly  

1. **Implication**: According to CVE-2005-0067, attackers can create false ICMP error messages to cause a Denial-of-Service attack. [More Info](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0067)

2. **Implication**: CVE-2020-3230 outlines that attackers can exploit IKEv2 to reach the maximum incoming negotiations, preventing further IKEv2 security associations. [More Info](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3230)

3. **Implication**: The 331 FTP response with "Give any password" suggests a vulnerability where only a username is needed to gain access, allowing malicious actions once inside.

### Recommended Solutions  

1. **First Vulnerability**: Verify FileZilla version and update via the FileZilla website if needed. [Download Update](https://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/)

2. **Second Vulnerability**: With a severity score of 9.8, action is urgent. Use secure remote access tools, limit access, or disable OpenSSH 5.5pl if remote access is unnecessary. [More Info](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-22-174-03)

3. **Third Vulnerability**: Update Linux systems using kernel 2.6.32 to avoid critical risks. [Update Instructions](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4225-1)

4. **First Anomaly**: Use `iptables` to filter ICMP packets and review error messages carefully.

5. **Second Anomaly**: Ensure systems are up to date, and consider using IKEv2 Denial-of-Service mitigation techniques. [Cisco Advisory](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev2-9p23Jj2a)

6. **Third Anomaly**: Hide username validation by always returning a 331 response and enforce strong password policies for added security.
