## Summary
A-Z Billing, a medical billing company serving surgery centers, needed to enhance data security as it grew. To comply with HIPAA and protect sensitive patient data, the company implemented a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution. This project involved assessing existing processes, implementing real-time monitoring, encryption, and access controls, and training employees on new security protocols. The DLP solution helped prevent unauthorized access, ensured HIPAA compliance, and improved data handling practices across the company.

## Review of Other Work
DLP implementations in sensitive data environments require strategies to prevent leaks through various channels. Studies by Takebayashi et al. (2010) emphasize real-time monitoring, especially in healthcare, to secure data at rest and in transit. Domnik and Holland (2024) propose a DLP Maturity Model to assess data security readiness, a key component in guiding A-Z Billing’s scalable DLP strategy. Costante et al. (2016) recommend a hybrid detection approach for DLP, combining anomaly-based and signature-based methods, improving threat detection and minimizing false positives.

## Changes to the Project Environment

### Original Environment
A-Z Billing relied on a basic IT infrastructure, including Dell OptiPlex desktops and Cisco Meraki network devices. The existing setup had limited monitoring or encryption and lacked robust access controls, which left sensitive patient data vulnerable to breaches.

### Post-Project Changes
The DLP implementation enhanced the infrastructure with real-time monitoring, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and role-based access controls. This included Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data in transit and automated alerts for suspicious activity, allowing swift responses to potential incidents. Employee training increased security awareness across the organization.

## Methodology
The project used the Waterfall methodology with five phases:

1. **Requirements**: Defined HIPAA compliance, data protection, and integration needs.
2. **Design**: Developed system architecture, including monitoring, encryption, and access controls.
3. **Implementation**: Deployed DLP across network and cloud services, configured access controls, and enforced encryption.
4. **Verification**: Conducted simulated breaches and validation testing to ensure DLP efficacy.
5. **Maintenance**: Ongoing monitoring and updates, periodic audits, and employee training.

## Unanticipated Scope Creep
During integration, the project team encountered challenges with A-Z Billing's legacy systems, requiring two extra days for configuration. The team adjusted resources and accelerated subsequent phases to keep the overall project timeline on track.

---

## Conclusions
The DLP implementation successfully improved A-Z Billing’s data security posture, ensuring HIPAA compliance, and enhancing operational efficiency. Despite minor delays, the project met its primary objectives, enabling real-time monitoring, encryption, and access control. The success was largely due to systematic planning, collaborative efforts, and employee training on data protection.
