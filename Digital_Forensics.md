### Abstract 

This forensic investigation project, conducted within a virtual lab environment using Autopsy, aimed to examine digital evidence on a workstation associated with a fictitious individual working for an oil company, John Smith. The investigation entailed creating a structured forensic case file, selecting the appropriate data source, and performing an in-depth analysis of files for confidential or suspicious content. Key findings included documents and images labeled as proprietary to the oil company, alongside materials outlining methods for anonymous cryptocurrency transactions and money laundering. Through detailed keyword searches, file type reviews, and metadata analysis, the investigation identified multiple files containing sensitive business strategies, drilling methodologies, and schematics. The presence of these materials suggested a potential violation of company policies, including a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and acceptable use policy (AUP). Although there was no direct evidence of intent to sell information, the findings raise concerns about unauthorized access and potential risks to the companyâ€™s proprietary data. This report summarizes the forensic process, findings, and implications for the oil company's management to consider for further action.

### Creation of Forensic System Case File in Autopsy

My investigation began by creating a new case in Autopsy. I named the case after the fictitious individual under investigation "JohnSmith". I then saved the case within a folder titled "Evidence Files".
